        <h2>Getting your parts ready.</h2>
        <p>Before putting your computer together its inportant to do research on the parts that make up a computer. There are many differnet parts available online. These are the basic components.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Motherboard</li>
                <li>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</li>
                <li>RAM (Random Access Memory) </li>
                <li>GPU (Graphical Processing Unit / <em>If Your CPU does not have integrated graphics.</em>)</li>
                <li>Storage: SSD (Solid State Drive) or HDD (Hard Disk Drive)</li>
                <li>PSU (Power Supply Unit)</li>
                <li>PC Case (This is not nessesary if you have a low budget.)</li>
                <li>Monitor</li>
                <li>Keyboard and mouse</li>
                <li>Screwdriver and other various tools</li>
            </ul>
        <p>It's important to make sure these parts are compatable with eachother. A powerfull website that I recommend using when picking out the parts you want is <a         href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/">Pc Part Picker.</a> This websites helps with making sure the parts you choose are compatible with eachother. Pc components can get expensive if you choose higher end products, so it is important to set a budget going in to the build. Before you build the computer is it also important to create a boot drive to your prefered operating system. The only thing you need is a USB drive and a working computer. Below is a helpful video on how to download the Windows 10 opperating system.

        <h2>Putting it all together.</h2>
        <p>Once you have all of your parts, its time to start putting it together. The basic steps go as follows: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Install the CPU in to the motherboard</li>
                <li>Install the memory </li>
                <li>Install the CPU cooler</li>
                <li>Install the motherboard in to the case, plug in case fans and front IO</li>
                <li>Plug in or install storage</li>
                <li>Install the power supply and plug all the required cables in</li>
                <li>Install the graphics card</li>
            </ol>

        <p>Building a computer can get confusing very quickly so having a video guide to follow or a person that has done it before is the easist way to ensure that you are doing everything correctly. You do not want to damage any of the parts so be gently and move slowly. If your parts are not plugging in or connecting easily do not keep pushing. Below is the video that helped me build my first PC with no issues! You might find it useful to watch this before you try it yourself, or refer back to it while you are in the process of making it.</p>
